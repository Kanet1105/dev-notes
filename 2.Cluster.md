# Cluster Setup Guide

Steps to setting up a cluster and joining new nodes.

## Bootstrapping a Cluster Using kubeadm
1. Run the following command to initialize the control plane:
```
sudo kubeadm init
```

2. Run the following command as a regular user.
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

3. Deploy a pod network to the cluster.
You must deploy a Container Network Interface (CNI) based Pod network add-on so that your Pods can communicate with each other. Cluster DNS (CoreDNS) will not start up before a network is installed.

```

```
