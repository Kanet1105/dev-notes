# Bootstrapping Highly Available Clusters using kubeadm

Because a stacked cluster runs the control plane and etcd on the name nodes, it bears the risk of failed coupling. 
To avoid this, we set up a cluster with a minimum of three external etcd nodes with network connections.

## Install a Container Runtime (containerd)

1. Forwarding IPv4 and letting iptables see bridged traffic.

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

# sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF

# Apply sysctl params without reboot
sudo sysctl --system
```

2. Verify that the br_netfilter, overlay modules are loaded.

```
lsmod | grep br_netfilter
lsmod | grep overlay
```

3. Verify that the net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables, net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables, 
net.ipv4.ip_forward system variables are set to 1 in your sysctl config

```
sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables net.ipv4.ip_forward
```
