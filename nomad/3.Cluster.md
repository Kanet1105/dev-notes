# Cluster on the Cloud

A guide to deploying a Nomad cluster with minimal infrastructure configuration. The cluster design follows the standard three server setup for HA, using Consul for automatic service discovery.

## Deploy Consul server

1. Verify Consul binary
```
consul version
```

2. Generate Consul server configuration.
In order to securely configure Consul by ensuring all communications between the Consul server and clients are inaccessible to unintended agents, you need to provide Consul with:
- A gossip encryption key.
- A root certificate authority (CA) certificate from a private CA. Consul will use this CA certificate to sign all certificates in the Consul datacenter.
- A certificate key-pair for each server you intend to deploy signed by the above CA.
In addition, you want to enable ACLs to ensure every request to your Consul datacenter is authorized.
