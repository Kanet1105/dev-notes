# Nomad Vocabulary

Getting familiar with terms associated with Nomad.

## Nomad cluster

agent - A Nomad agent is a Nomad process running in server or client mode. Agents are the basic building block of a Nomad cluster.

dev agent - A Nomad development agent is a special configuration that provides useful defaults for running experiments with Nomad. It runs in server and client mode and does not persist its cluster state to disk, which allows your agent to start from a repeatable clean state without having to remove disk based state between runs. Nomad dev agents are for development and experimental use only. To learn about production Nomad deployments, consult the Enterprise Reference Architecture and Deployment Guides collection.

server - A Nomad agent running in server mode. Nomad servers are the brains of the cluster. There is a cluster of servers per region and they manage all jobs and clients, run evaluations, and create task allocations. The servers replicate data between each other and perform leader election to ensure high availability. Servers federate across regions to make Nomad globally aware. All servers in a region are members of the same gossip domain and consensus group.

leader - The leader is a Nomad server that performs the bulk of the cluster management. It is in charge of applying plans, deriving Vault tokens for the workloads, and maintaining the cluster state.

follower - Non-leader Nomad servers. Followers create scheduling plans and submit them to the leader to provide more scheduling capacity to the cluster.

client - A Nomad agent running in client mode. Client agents are responsible for registering themselves with the servers, watching for any work to be assigned, and executing tasks. Clients create a multiplexed connection to the servers. This enables topologies that require NAT punch-through. Once connected, the servers use this connection to forward RPC calls to the clients as necessary.
