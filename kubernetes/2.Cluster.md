# Cluster Setup Guide

Steps to setting up a cluster and joining new nodes.

## Bootstrapping a Cluster Using kubeadm

1. Open /etc/fstab with a text editor and comment out the swap line.

2. Run the following command to initialize the control plane:
```
sudo kubeadm init
```

3. Run the following command as a regular user.
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

4. Deploy a pod network to the cluster.
You must deploy a Container Network Interface (CNI) based Pod network add-on so that your Pods can communicate with each other. Cluster DNS (CoreDNS) will not start up before a network is installed.
```
# Download the Calico networking manifest for the Kubernetes API datastore:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.0/manifests/calico.yaml -O

# Apply the manifest using the following command:
kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
```

5. Join any number of worker nodes by running the following command as root:
```
# On a worker node, run the following command as root:
kubeadm join --token TOKEN_STRING \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:HASH_STRING
```

## Generating a new token for joining a new worker node.
```
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```
