# Restricted Licenses

Licenses in this category requires mandatory source disclosure. However, what 
particularly concerns us is that criteria of source code disclosure is debatable.
Using such licenses in a commercial software is advised against even if the product 
dynamically links the open-source library and does not embed the source code directly 
because disclosing the source may increase security risks and possibly breach 
data privacy if the product is shipped as IaaS or FaaS which involves consumer code or 
scripts when using the service.
